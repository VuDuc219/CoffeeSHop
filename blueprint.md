# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This is a Flutter application for a coffee shop. It allows users to browse different coffee categories, view product details, and will eventually include features for authentication and ordering.

## Implemented Features

*   **Home Screen:** Displays a banner, a search bar, and sections for "Today's Special" and "Best Sellers".
*   **Category Screen:** Shows a list of coffee categories.
*   **Product Detail Screen:** Shows details for a selected product.
*   **Asset Management:**
    *   Images for banners, products, and icons are stored in `assets/images/` and `assets/icons/`.
    *   `pubspec.yaml` is configured to include these assets.
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   `velocity_x`: For UI development.
    *   `get`: For state management and navigation.
    *   `firebase_core`: For Firebase integration.
    *   `firebase_auth`: For authentication.
    *   `firebase_storage`: For file storage.
    *   `cloud_firestore`: For database.

## Current Plan

*   Configure Firebase for the project.
*   Implement user authentication (login and signup).
*   Integrate with Firestore to manage user data and product information.
